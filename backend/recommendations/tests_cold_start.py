"""
Integration tests for recommendation cold-start scenarios (#1209).

Cold-start is the condition where either:
  - a brand-new wallet has no indexed activity at all, OR
  - a brand-new campaign has zero contributions / no history.

These are critical edge cases because the scoring functions receive empty
or near-empty inputs that could cause division-by-zero, empty result sets,
or crashed responses.  Every test below asserts one of:

  1. The service returns HTTP 200 (no crash).
  2. The fallback is the trending list (``personalised: false``).
  3. The response body is well-formed and non-empty where campaigns exist.
  4. A zero-history campaign still surfaces in trending when the scoring
     math is valid.

Fallback behaviour contract (documented here per AC):
  - Unknown wallet → returns trending campaigns, ``personalised: false``.
  - Wallet with empty activity (no contributions, no preferred categories)
    → same as unknown wallet: trending, ``personalised: false`` (the
    wallet key IS present in _ACTIVITY but carries no signal).
  - ``wallet`` param omitted → trending, ``personalised: false``.
  - Zero active campaigns in the store → returns an empty
    ``recommendations`` list, not an error.
