//! # Fund-My-Cause Achievements Contract
//!
//! A Soroban smart contract for managing user achievements, NFT badges, and gamification
//! on the Fund My Cause platform.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The achievements contract tracks user progress and awards NFT badges for:
//! - Contribution milestones
//! - Social engagement
//! - Referral success
//! - Community support
//! - Campaign goals reached
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Achievement System** - 12+ unique achievements with tiers (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary)
//! - **NFT Badges** - Mint NFTs for achievement milestones
//! - **Points System** - Award points for activities (achievements, contributions, referrals)
//! - **Leaderboards** - Track top contributors, referrers, and achievement collectors
//! - **Contribution Streaks** - Reward consecutive daily contributions
//! - **Level System** - Progress from level 1-100 based on points
//! - **Referral Tracking** - Monitor referral success and rewards
//! - **Challenge Tracking** - Track participation in limited-time challenges
//! - **Audit Trail** - Complete history of achievement unlocks
//!
//! ## Achievement State Machine
//!
//! Each `(user, achievement_type)` pair has exactly two states:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [Locked] --unlock--> [Unlocked]
//! ```
//!
//! - **Locked**: no `DataKey::Achievement(user, achievement_type)` entry exists.
//!   `has_achievement` returns `false`.
//! - **Unlocked**: an `AchievementRecord` is stored under that key (points
//!   already awarded, leaderboard entry already posted, `unlocked` event
//!   already published). This is terminal — there is no further "claimed"
//!   state or reversal; `Unlocked` is permanent for the life of the contract.
//!
//! There is no separate "eligible" state stored on-chain: eligibility is
//! evaluated at call time, not persisted.
//!
//! **Transitions in are gated by achievement type:**
//!
//! - Types `{2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}` ("self-declared") — transition
//!   Locked → Unlocked via [`AchievementsContract::unlock_achievement`],
//!   callable directly by the user. Eligibility for these is enforced
//!   off-chain (e.g. by the platform deciding when to let a user submit the
//!   call); the contract itself only checks the type is valid and not
//!   already unlocked.
//! - Types `{1, 3, 4, 7}` ("auto-tracked": First Contribution, Mega Donor,
//!   Consistent Contributor, Referral Champion) — transition Locked →
//!   Unlocked *only* via the internal `try_auto_unlock` helper, invoked from
//!   [`AchievementsContract::record_contribution`] /
//!   [`AchievementsContract::record_referral`] once the on-chain counters
//!   they read (`ContributionCount`, `ContributionTotal`, `ReferralCount`)
//!   cross the relevant threshold. `unlock_achievement` explicitly **rejects**
//!   these four types with `AchievementNotSelfUnlockable` — see the fix note
//!   below.
//!
//! **Illegal transitions rejected:**
//! - Unlocked → Unlocked (re-unlocking) → `AchievementAlreadyUnlocked`.
//! - Locked → Unlocked for an out-of-range type → `InvalidAchievementType`.
//! - Locked → Unlocked for an auto-tracked type via the manual entry point →
//!   `AchievementNotSelfUnlockable`.
//!
//! **Design/implementation mismatch found and fixed (#928):** prior to this
//! fix, `unlock_achievement` had no gate on achievement type beyond range
//! validation, so any user could call
//! `unlock_achievement(user, 1 /* First Contribution */, "")` — or type 3, 4,
//! 7 — immediately after initialization, without ever having contributed or
//! referred anyone, and be credited the full points/leaderboard/NFT for it.
//! That let the four auto-tracked achievements bypass the on-chain activity
//! they're supposed to certify. Fixed by rejecting those four types in
//! `unlock_achievement`.

#![no_std]
// The SDK deprecated `Events::publish` in favour of the `#[contractevent]` macro.
// Migrating changes how events are encoded on the wire, so it is a behaviour change
// for every off-chain consumer, not a lint cleanup, and is tracked separately.
