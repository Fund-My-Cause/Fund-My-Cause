//! Typed event payloads for the achievements contract.

//! Follows the shared convention documented in `common::events` (issue
//! #924): topic = `("achievements", event_name)`, named fields (never raw
//! tuples), identifying fields first, `schema_version` last. Only events
//! actually emitted by `lib.rs` are defined here — see each struct's doc
//! comment for its topic and call site.
