//! # Fund-My-Cause Registry Contract
//!
//! A lightweight Soroban contract that maintains a deduplicated, paginated list
//! of all deployed [`CrowdfundContract`] campaign addresses on the Stellar network.
//!
//! ## Access Control
//!
//! | Function | Authorization required |
//! |---|---|
//! | `initialize` | `admin.require_auth()` — one-time setup |
//! | `register` | `campaign_id.require_auth()` — campaign signs its own registration |
//! | `register_with_category` | `campaign_id.require_auth()` |
//! | `register_with_status` | `campaign_id.require_auth()` |
//! | `update_status` | stored admin `require_auth()` |
//! | `list` / `list_by_status` / `get_campaigns_by_category` | public read — no auth |
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! All campaign addresses are stored in a single instance-storage entry under
//! the `CMPLIST` key as a `Vec<Address>`. Deduplication is enforced on write.
//! The admin address is stored under `ADMIN` and set once during `initialize`.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! The contract's public entry points (below) are thin delegating wrappers —
//! this file owns the single `#[contractimpl]` block (Soroban generates one
//! `RegistryContractClient` per contract, so the callable surface must stay
//! in one place), plus the storage keys and small helpers shared by both:
//! - [`admin`] — every function that mutates registry state: the two
//!   admin-gated ones (`initialize`, `update_status`) and the three
//!   campaign-self-authorized registration entry points.
//! - [`lookup`] — the three public, read-only, unauthenticated queries.

#![no_std]
// The SDK deprecated `Events::publish` in favour of the `#[contractevent]` macro.
// Migrating changes how events are encoded on the wire, so it is a behaviour change
// for every off-chain consumer, not a lint cleanup, and is tracked separately.
#![allow(deprecated)]
