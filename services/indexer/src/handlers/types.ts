 * The EventDispatcher groups incoming events by type and routes each group to
 * the matching handler via this interface.
 *
 * Implementing a new domain handler:
 *  1. Create a class that implements EventHandler under
 *     `handlers/<contractType>/`, creating the directory if the contract
 *     type is new.
 *  2. Set `eventType` to the string that appears in IndexerEvent.type, and
 *     `contractType` to the owning contract family.
 *  3. Export the class from handlers/index.ts.
 *  4. Register it in the EventDispatcher instantiation in index.ts, and if
 *     the contract type is new, add its contract ID to the RPC client's
 *     `contractIds` list.
